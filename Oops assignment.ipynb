    "**Q.1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object: An instance of a class. It is created from a class and can access the class's attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting access to certain components using access modifiers like private, protected, or public.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance: The ability to create a new class (subclass) that inherits the properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism: The ability of different objects to respond to the same function or method call in different ways. It allows methods to be used interchangeably on objects of different classes, typically through method overriding or overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts work together to make OOP a powerful programming paradigm for organizing and structuring code."

    "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the sequence in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. This is particularly important in the context of multiple inheritance, where a class is derived from more than one base class. The MRO determines the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method.\n",
